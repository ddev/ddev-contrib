# Excludes ddev from Git Custom Command (ddev git-exclude)

Copy the [git-exclude](./git-exclude) command to the .ddev/commands/host/ directory or the global ~/.ddev/commands/host directory (to make it work for all projects).

now you can run `ddev git-exclude` and avoid tracking the ddev files in git.
