[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a "complete end-to-end testing experience". It allows you to write Javascript test files that automate real browsers.  For more details, see the [Cypress Overview](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) page.

This recipe integrates a Cypress docker image with your DDEV project.

## Steps

- Copy the `docker-compose.cypress.yaml` file into your project's `./.ddev' directory.
- Copy the `commands` directory into your project's `./.ddev/commands` directory.
- Restart DDEV to begin using the this service.

    ```shell
    ddev restart
    ```

### Configure `DISPLAY`

To correctly display the Cypress screen and browser output, you must configure a `DISPLAY` environment variable.

#### Windows 10

If you are running DDEV on Win10 or WSL2 on Win10, you need to configure a display server on Win10.
You are free to use any X11-compatible server. A configuration-free solution is to install [GWSL via the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/gwsl/9nl6kd1h33v3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

##### Running DDEV on Win10 (not WSL)

- Install [GWSL via the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/gwsl/9nl6kd1h33v3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- Get you "IPv4 Address" for your "Ethernet adapter" via networking panel or by typing `ipconfig` in a terminal. The address in the below example is `192.168.0.196`

```shell
‚ùØ ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration


Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.196
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
```

- In your project `./docker-compose.cypress.yaml`, add the IPv4 address and `:0` (EG. `192.168.0.196:0` ) to the display section under environment.

```yaml
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=192.168.0.196:0
```

### A note about the Cypress image

This recipe uses the latest `cypress/include` image (`cypress/include:8.6.0`) which includes the following browsers:

- Chrome 91
- Firefox 89
- Electron 91

It is considered best practice to use a [specific image tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images#best-practice).

- If you require a specific browser, update `image` in your `./.ddev/docker-compose.cypress.yaml`.
- Available images and versions can be found on the [cypress-docker-images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) page.

## Commands

Cypress can run into 2 different modes: interactive and runner.
This recipe includes 2 alias commands to help you use Cypress.

### `cypress-open`

To open cypress in "interactive" mode, run the following command:

```shell
ddev cypress-open
```

This command also accepts arguments. Refer to the ["#cyress open" documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) for further details.

Example: To open Cypress in interactive mode, and specify a config file

```shell
ddev cypress-open --config cypress.json
```

### `cypress-run`

To run Cypress in "runner" mode, run the following command:

```shell
ddev cypress-run
```

This command also accepts arguments. Refer to [#cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) page for a full list of available arguments.

Example: To run all Cypress tests, using Chrome in headless mode

```shell
ddev cypress-run --browser chrome
```

## Notes

- The dockerized Cypress *should* find any locally installed plugins in your project's `node_modules`.
- Some plugins may require additional settings, such as environmental variables. These can be passed through via command arguments.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find a Cypress configuration file, exiting"

Cypress expects a directory strutures containing the tests, plugins and support files.

- If the `./cypress` directory does not exist, it will scaffold out these directories, including a default `cypress.json` setting file and example tests when you first run `ddev cypress-open`.
- Make sure you have a `cypress.json` file in your project root, or use `--config [file]` argument to specify one.

### "Unable to open X display."

- This recipe forwards the Cypress GUI via an X11 / X410 server. Please ensure you have this working on your host system.
- For Windows 10 users, try [GWSL](https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/tutorials/manual.html) (via [Microsoft store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9NL6KD1H33V3)), or [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (via [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vcxsrv#versionhistory))
