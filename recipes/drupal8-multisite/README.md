# DDEV-Local Drupal 8 Multisite Recipe

DDEV supports Drupal 8 multisite, however it is not always obvious what changes need to be done to make it work. Additionally, sometimes setup helpful for single-site configuration blocks the desired behavior for a multi-site setup.

This example will show how to setup a basic two-site multisite configuration, covering ddev, database, drush, and other issues. It has been tested on macOS, but should work anywhere.

Neither of the sites will be default to ensure that if something is misconfigured, commands will fail against incomplete Drupal site instance instead of silently running against wrong one.

## Initial DDEV-Local and Drupal 8 setup

Let's mostly follow the suggested configuration in [the official DDEV documentation for Drupal 8 setup](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#drupal-8-quickstart).

1. mkdir d8m
2. cd d8m
3. ddev config --project-type php
4. ddev composer create drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev --stability dev --no-interaction --prefer-dist
5. ddev config --project-type drupal8
6. ddev restart
7. ddev describe

This gets us to the basic Drupal 8 site using composer setup At this point, if you go to the assigned URL (<https://d8m.ddev.site),> you will see Drupal's site creation dialogue. Let's leave that as is and not configure the default site.

Let's create two sites:

* **basic** - using *standard* install profile
* **umami** - using *umami* install profile

## Prepare the databases and URLs

The file `.ddev/config.yaml` is where additional URLs are setup and where we can use hooks to create the databases. However, it may be better to use [a separate override config file](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#extending-configyaml-with-custom-configyaml-files) to keep that information more clear and easier to track. The combination of sites may also be different on each individual machine, so this file may or may not be checked into the version control.

To setup the databases, we can add the command into the *post-start* hook. And the hostnames are declared in *additional_hostnames* options.

So, let's setup an `.ddev/config.multisite.yaml` with additional information for both of our sites. Notice that while it is possible to have multiple config files, they specific options override each other, not extend. So, it is not possible to have one extension config file per site.

1. Copy [example config.multisite.yaml](dot.ddev/config.multisite.yaml) to your setup's .ddev directory.
2. ddev restart

You should get a message that additional domains are now available:

> Your project can be reached at <https://basic.ddev.site> <https://d8m.ddev.site> <https://umami.ddev.site> <https://127.0.0.1:32817>

## Enable the `ddev drush` custom command

Drush is useful, but it is a bit annoying to `ddev ssh` into the container all the time or to run `ddev exec drush`. Fortunately, DDEV has [Custom commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/).  And drush is one of the examples, so it just needs to be copied.

1. cp .ddev/commands/web/drush.example .ddev/commands/web/drush
2. ddev drush status

## Enable multisite

First we need to enable the multisite support by copying `example.sites.php` to `sites.php`. And then, because we are using DDEV for development and our production URLs will be different from test URLs, we want to define explicit aliases. That also allows us to have nice site directory names.

1. `cd web/sites`
2. `mkdir basic umami`
3. `cp example.sites.php sites.php`
4. Configure sites in the sites.php to match the URL with the correct directory.
5. If you know production URLs, you can add them at the same time.

The final `sites.php` should look something like the [example included](web/sites/sites.php).

## Disable DDEV's global drush.yml

Now we have to do a DDEV specific thing. Trying to be helpful, it creates a global drush configuration file that sets `uri` option for the default project url. [This is not recommended for multisite configuration](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/4dea224bfcb539fe2c11ff366d7d325223958ec4/examples/example.drush.yml#L84-L87) as it may confuse drush into silently using wrong site.

We want to disable that option. However, the file is DDEV generated, so we can't just comment the line out, it may get regenerated. We need to remove the auto-generation marker lines as well. We can make this file empty.

1. Edit `drush/drush.yml` and delete all content including comments
2. Explicitly check the file in to git, if you use git (it has to be explicit, as DDEV also creates a local `.gitignore` file)

## Prepare example umami site

Normally, with multisite install, a `settings.php` file is copied from `sites/default` directory. However, DDEV adds its own parallel config file (`settings.ddev.php`). As that ddev file is also auto-managed, just copying it may cause problems later. One of the things it includes is database configuration, so we can't just ignore it. And we also can't just copy `settings.php`, as the inclusion statement is site local and it will not find the additional file back in `sites/default` directory.

For this example, we are just going to include both `settings.php` and `settings.ddev.php` by direct reference and then override some values ([see example](web/sites/umami/settings.php)). The best solution may look a bit different.

1. `cd web/sites/umami`
2. create `settings.php`
3. Edit the file to directly include both `sites/default/settings.php` and `sites/default/settings.ddev.php` (if present)
4. Add override option for default database name, as we gave default "db" user access to all our databases. This keeps things simpler.

Now, if `drush status` is run from within *web* container's `sites/umami` directory, the output should look similar to following:

```
web/sites/umami$ drush status -l umami.ddev.site
 Drupal version   : 8.8.1
 Site URI         : https://umami.ddev.site
 DB driver        : mysql
 DB hostname      : db
 DB port          : 3306
 DB username      : db
 DB name          : umami
 Database         : Connected
 Drupal bootstrap : Successful
 Default theme    : umami
 Admin theme      : seven
 PHP binary       : /usr/bin/php7.2
 PHP config       : /etc/php/7.2/cli/php.ini
 PHP OS           : Linux
 Drush script     : /usr/local/bin/drush
 Drush version    : 9.7.1
 Drush temp       : /tmp
 Drush configs    : /var/www/html/vendor/drush/drush/drush.yml
                    /var/www/html/drush/drush.yml
                    /var/www/html/web/sites/all/drush/drush.yml
 Install profile  : demo_umami
 Drupal root      : /var/www/html/web
 Site path        : sites/umami
 Files, Public    : sites/umami/files
 Files, Temp      : /tmp
 ```

If *Site path* looks different or DB information is missing, that means something has gone wrong.

Note that this has be run from inside the container and not from outside with `ddev drush` as drush needs to know which site we are referencing. This will be fixed once we have drush aliases in place.

## Install the umami demo site

Now, visiting <https://umami.ddev.site> will show the site creation form. Going through the form and setting the values and defaults (including *Demo: Umami* profile) will create the Umami Food Magazine site.

Notice that visiting either <https://basic.ddev.site> or <https://d8m.ddev.site> still shows the site creation form.

And reruning `drush status` inside the `sites/umami` directory inside the *web* container should now show additional information from the initialized site.

## Install the "basic" demo site

We can follow the same steps for the "basic"" site. We already have the directory, URL, database, and `sites.php` setup. So all that needs to be done is:

1. Copy `settings.php` from `sites/umami` directory and change database name to "basic".
2. Visit <https://basic.ddev.site> and install the site with the *Standard* profile

Now, we have a simple Drupal site at <https://basic.ddev.site,> a food magazine at <https://umami.ddev.site> and still only a configuration form at the original <https://d8m.ddev.site.>

## Set up drush site aliases

[Drush site aliases](http://docs.drush.org/en/9.x/usage/#site-aliases) help to address individual sites without being in the specific directory inside the web container. There is an example *self.site.yml* already with `drush/sites` folder, showing the basic format for default (self) site with environments *prod* and *stage*.

We'll set the *root* and *uri* parameters to point to the Drupal root (within container) and the full url to the site instance.

1. `cd drush/sites`
2. Copy the aliases files into your project's drush/sites directory from this [drush/sites](drush/sites) directory
3. Run `ddev drush site:alias` from outside the container to check that the alias is recognized
4. Run `ddev drush @umami.ddev status` to check that all site-specific information is now present, including full *Site URI*
5. Run `ddev drush @basic.ddev status` to check that the alias is working for the second site too.
6. Run `ddev drush status` to see what the default configuration still shows.

## Add more sites

Now that we have a basic setup in place, new site requires us to:

1. Update ddev's [config.multisite.yaml](dot.ddev/config.multisite.yaml) to add the database and set the additional_hostnames (remember to run `ddev restart` to pick up the changes). This can also be done directly in the .ddev/config.yaml.
2. Create a directory for the new site in `web/sites/<newsitename>`.
3. Copy `settings.php` to the new directory and updating the database name.
4. Add new alias to the `sites.php`.
5. Copy a drush alias and updating the `uri` option.
6. Visit each new site to install Drupal.

## Conclusion

Of course much more work lies ahead.  The `settings.php` file alone may need a lot more additional configuration. This however, is a standard Drupal issue covered in the documentation.

The focus of this example was to show how to get the basics working within the DDEV-Local environment.
