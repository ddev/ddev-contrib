# ddev-contrib: Contrib for DDEV

Contrib space for DDEV services, tools, snippets, and approaches.

## config.yaml hook examples

* [Import a SQL dump if database is empty](hook-examples/import-db-if-empty/)

## docker-compose.*.yaml snippets to solve simple problems

Don't forget the [Official documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-compose-files/).

* [Mounting a directory into web container](docker-compose-snippets/mounting-directory/)
* [Setting an environment variable](docker-compose-snippets/environment-variable/docker-compose.env.yaml)
* [Communication between two DDEV projects](docker-compose-snippets/project-communication/)
* [Set default language (or other settings) in phpmyadmin](docker-compose-snippets/phpmyadmin-user-settings/)

## Custom command examples

DDEV's [custom commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/custom-commands/) are a great way to add team-level or project-level commands. They're simple scripts that can be run in any of the containers or on the host. Note that several examples are already shipped with DDEV, you'll find them in .ddev/commands/*/*.example, and then can be enabled by symlinking or copying.)

* [Dump and deploy SQL from/to remote servers](custom-commands/dump-and-deploy-db/)
* [Fetch Production DB from remote server](custom-commands/fetchproductiondb/)

* [Enable and view MySQL/MariaDB GENERAL_LOG](custom-commands/general-log/)
* [inotify-proxy to enable file watchers on NFS shares](custom-commands/inotify-proxy)
* [Executing Symfony console and phpunit commands without ssh](custom-commands/symfony/)
* [Build Drupal theme assets with Gulp](custom-commands/gulp) -- with minor modifications, this approach will work for other frameworks (WordPress, etc.) and other front-end build tools.
* [Run Laravel `tinker` or Drupal's `drush php` with a single command](custom-commands/tinker)
* [Stop all running projects except the current](custom-commands/stop-other)
* [Dynamically enable / disable a service](custom-commands/dynamic-service)
