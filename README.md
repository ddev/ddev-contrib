# ddev-contrib: Contrib for DDEV-Local

Contrib space for DDEV-Local services, tools, snippets, approaches.

## docker-compose.*.yaml snippets to solve simple problems

## Custom command examples

Ddev's [custom commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/custom-commands/) are a great way to add team-level or project-level commands. They're simple scripts that can be run in any of the containers or on the host. Note that several examples are already shipped with ddev, you'll find them in .ddev/commands/*/*.example, and then can be enabled by symlinking or copying.)

* [Dump and deploy SQL from/to remote servers](custom-commands/dump-and-deploy-db/)
* [Fetch Production DB from remote server](custom-commands/fetchproductiondb/)
* [Exclude ddev directory from git: git-exclude](custom-commands/git-exclude)
